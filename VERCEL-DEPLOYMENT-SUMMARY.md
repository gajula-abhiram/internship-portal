# Vercel Deployment Summary

## Project Status

✅ **Ready for Vercel Deployment**

The Internship Portal is fully configured and ready for deployment to Vercel's serverless platform.

## Key Configuration Files

### 1. vercel.json
- Configured with proper build settings
- Environment variables for production
- Security headers
- Cron jobs for health checks

### 2. next.config.js
- Properly configured for Vercel deployment
- External package handling for `better-sqlite3`
- Security headers
- Output tracing for optimized deployments

### 3. package.json
- Contains all required scripts (`build`, `start`)
- Proper dependencies and devDependencies
- Deployment-related scripts

## Database Configuration

### Memory Database for Serverless
The application automatically uses an in-memory database when deployed to Vercel, which is appropriate for serverless environments:

- Implemented in `src/lib/memory-database.ts`
- Pre-populated with realistic Rajasthan-specific sample data
- Same interface as SQLite database for seamless switching
- No data persistence between requests (appropriate for serverless)

### SQLite Database for Development
For local development, the application uses SQLite:

- Implemented in `src/lib/database.ts`
- Database file stored as `internship.db`
- Automatically initializes with sample data

## API Routes

All application functionality is exposed through Next.js API routes:

- Located in `src/app/api/`
- Properly structured for Vercel's serverless functions
- Each route is deployed as a separate serverless function

## Environment Handling

The application automatically detects when it's running on Vercel:

```javascript
const isVercelProduction = process.env.VERCEL === '1';
```

And switches to the appropriate database implementation automatically.

## Deployment Verification

✅ All required files present
✅ Required scripts configured
✅ Vercel configuration valid
✅ Database abstraction implemented
✅ API routes properly structured

## Deployment Steps

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Deploy with default settings
4. (Optional) Configure custom domain

## Scaling Considerations

For production use with data persistence, consider migrating to a cloud database:
- PlanetScale (MySQL)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- MongoDB Atlas
- AWS DynamoDB

The application is structured to make this migration straightforward through the database abstraction layer.

## Next Steps

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Connect to Vercel
3. Deploy!
