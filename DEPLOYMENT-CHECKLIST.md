# Deployment Configuration Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Setup ‚úÖ

### GitHub Repository Setup
- [ ] Repository is public or Vercel has access to private repo
- [ ] All code is committed and pushed to main/master branch
- [ ] `.gitignore` properly excludes sensitive files

- [ ] Email functionality tested (if enabled)

### Post-Deployment Validation
- [ ] Deployment completed successfully
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Core functionality tested on live site
- [ ] Performance acceptable (load times, responsiveness)

## Domain & SSL üåê

### Domain Configuration (if custom domain)
- [ ] Custom domain added in Vercel
- [ ] DNS records configured correctly
