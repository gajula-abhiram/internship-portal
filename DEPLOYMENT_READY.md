- âœ… No filesystem dependencies that could cause issues
- âœ… Optimized build process with no errors
- âœ… Serverless function timeout and memory settings configured

### âœ… Demo Accounts with Working Credentials
All demo accounts have been verified with working passwords:
- **Student**: `amit.sharma` / `Password123!`

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Deploy to Vercel

#### Option A: Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel
```

#### Option B: Git Integration
1. Push code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. Import project in Vercel dashboard
3. Configure with:
   - Framework: Next.js
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`

### 2. Environment Variables
Vercel will automatically use the configuration in `vercel.json`, but you can also set these manually:

```
ENABLE_MEMORY_DB=true
DATABASE_URL=memory://
VERCEL=1
NODE_ENV=production
VERCEL_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secure-nextauth-secret
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
1. Visit your deployed URL
2. Test login with demo credentials
3. Verify all user roles can access their dashboards
4. Check that data is displayed correctly
5. Test API endpoints at `/api/health`

## ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Build Failures**
- Solution: Ensure Node.js 18+ is used
- Solution: Check all dependencies are in `package.json`

**Runtime Errors**
- Solution: Verify environment variables are set
- Solution: Check memory database configuration

**Authentication Issues**
- Solution: Ensure JWT secrets are properly configured
- Solution: Verify password hashing works (tested and working)

**Missing Data**
- Solution: Memory database automatically initializes with sample data
- Solution: All demo accounts have associated data
