# Vercel Configuration Fix

## Issue Resolved

The `vercel.json` file had an invalid `typescript` property that was causing deployment issues with the error message:
```
Invalid request: should NOT have additional property `typescript`. Please remove it.
```

## Fix Applied

Removed the invalid `typescript` property from `vercel.json`:

**Before:**
```json
{
  // ... other properties
  "typescript": {
    "tsconfigPath": "tsconfig.json"
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  // ... other properties (typescript property removed)
}
```

## Verification

1. ✅ `vercel.json` no longer contains the invalid `typescript` property
2. ✅ `npm run build` completes successfully without errors
3. ✅ All existing functionality remains intact
4. ✅ Application is ready for Vercel deployment

## Why This Fix Works

The `typescript` property is not a valid configuration option for Vercel deployments. TypeScript configuration is handled automatically by Vercel's Next.js framework detection and the existing `tsconfig.json` file. Removing this invalid property resolves the deployment error while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Deployment Ready

The Internship Portal is now fully configured for deployment to Vercel with:
- ✅ Valid `vercel.json` configuration
- ✅ Successful build process
- ✅ All demo accounts working with posted data
- ✅ No synthetic data indicators in UI
- ✅ No "npm exited with 1" errors
- ✅ Optimized for serverless environment
