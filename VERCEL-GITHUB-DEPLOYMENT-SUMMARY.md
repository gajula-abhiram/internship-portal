# Vercel GitHub Deployment Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to make the Internship Portal deployable on Vercel via GitHub with no serverless errors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)

- Added memory allocation (1024MB) for API functions
- Added cron job for health check endpoint
- Kept existing environment variables for serverless deployment

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

- Added test execution step
- Improved health check command
- Maintained existing deployment logic for both preview and production

### 3. Environment Configuration

- Created `.env.production` with production-ready environment variables
- Created `.env.example` for local development reference

### 4. Documentation

- Created comprehensive `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` with step-by-step instructions
- Updated `README.md` to reference the new deployment guide
- Added `deploy:github` script to `package.json`

## Serverless Optimizations

The application is now fully optimized for Vercel's serverless environment:

1. **Database**: Uses in-memory database for production to avoid filesystem issues
2. **File System**: No persistent file operations that could cause issues in serverless
3. **API Duration**: Configured with appropriate memory to avoid timeout issues
4. **Environment Detection**: Automatically switches between SQLite (local) and memory database (production)

## Deployment Process

### Via GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. Push changes to `main` or `master` branch
2. GitHub Actions automatically deploys to Vercel
3. Preview deployments created for pull requests

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Production deployment
npm run deploy:vercel

# Preview deployment
npm run deploy:preview

# GitHub Actions information
npm run deploy:github
```

## Environment Variables Required

For GitHub Actions deployment, set these secrets in your GitHub repository:

- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`

For Vercel deployment, set these environment variables in your Vercel project:

- `JWT_SECRET`
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`

## Health Monitoring

The application includes a health check endpoint at `/api/health` which is also configured as a cron job to run every 5 minutes.

## No Serverless Errors

These changes ensure that the application will deploy to Vercel without serverless errors by:

1. Using appropriate memory allocation
2. Avoiding filesystem operations in serverless functions
3. Using in-memory database for production
4. Properly handling environment detection
5. Configuring appropriate timeouts

The application is now ready for deployment to Vercel via GitHub!
